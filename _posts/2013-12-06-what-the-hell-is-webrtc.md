category: Technology
---

Me and Trond Kjetil from [appear.in](https://appear.in) held a talk at the
Google Developer Group here in Oslo on Wednesday. The talk
was about WebRTC, what it is, and how you use it. We also talked about
[appear.in](https://appear.in), how it all started, and where we go next.

The talk was recorded, and you can watch the whole thing below.
