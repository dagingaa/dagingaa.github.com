I just held a talk about "Dispelling (some of) the magic in AngularJS" for a
group of ~80 people at [AngularJS Oslo meetup](http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Oslo/).
Below is a synopsis of the talk.

One of the biggest challenges with AngularJS is trying to understand some of
the magic under the hood. What makes it tick? In this talk we try to dispel
some of the magic, so you can feel more confident when Angular takes control.

A written transcript will follow hopefully very, very soon.
