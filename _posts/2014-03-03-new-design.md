I got sick and tired of the new design. It wasn't responsive, it was very
heavy, and I had almost no artistic control over it. So, yesterday, I sat down
and came up with a new one.

The new design is fairly simple, and based on what I've enjoyed reading and
looking at elsewhere. It's based on [the very talented HÃ¥kon Erichsen's
blog](http://haeric.github.io/), and also the design of [Jonas Myrlund](http://myrlund.no/).

I used [Typeplate](http://typeplate.com/) to get the typography right, in
combination with Roboto Condensed and Roboto Slab. All my custom CSS can be
found [on Github](https://github.com/dagingaa/dagingaa.github.com/blob/master/assets/css/style.scss).
It isn't very long, or very pretty, but it does the job.
