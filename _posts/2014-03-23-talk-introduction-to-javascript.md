This weekend I held a workshop about JavaScript for a very talented group of
students in the IT department of ISFiT. [ISFiT is a student
festival](http://isfit.org), biennially
inviting 500 students from over 100 countries to Trondheim, Norway for 11 days.
Each festival has a theme, and this festival's theme is "Corruption".

The workshop lasted a little bit under 6 hours, with a short pizza break in the
middle, sponsored by my employer, [Telenor Digital](http://telenordigital.com/).

The workshop takes you from a basic understanding of the JavaScript language,
based on the excellent [Introduction to JavaScript on
MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript),
to working with the DOM and finally a short sneak peek into AngularJS.

[Slides are as always
available](http://daginge.com/slides/introduction-to-javascript/#/), although
without speaker notes this time. Interestingly, the slides now feature the same
design as I use on this blog.

If you, are any organization you know, wants to have a similar workshop, don't
hesitate to contact me.
