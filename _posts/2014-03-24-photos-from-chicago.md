        <h1 class="beta">Cloud gate</h1>
        <p class="drop-cap">A picture I took of the Cloud gate when I was doing a photo run in Chicago. Absolutely stunning in real life, the picture doesn't do it justice.</p>

    <div class="well bottom left">
        <h1 class="gamma">N Michigan Avenue</h1>
        <p class="drop-cap">The streets were always busy with both people and cars. Yet, the whole thing felt very "clean". Absolutely one of the most stunning and beautiful cities I have visited.</p>

    <div class="well top left">
        <h1 class="beta">Ballons</h1>
        <p class="drop-cap">Some ballons I found. I think it belongs to some kind of festival going on at the time. I like the colors and the perfect blue sky. Motivational.</p>

    <div class="well black bottom left">
        <h1 class="beta">Squirrel</h1>
        <p class="drop-cap">A squirrel in the middle of the city. Very people friendly, and got really close. My new 35mm lens was perfect for getting this shot, and it might be one of the picture's I'm most happy with from Chicago. I didn't even notice the syringes in the background before I got home.</p>
