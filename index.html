      <h1>I love programming.</h1>
      <p>I believe programming languages and frameworks are tools, much like that of a mechanic or a carpenter. I believe you should always use the best tool for the right job. That's why I strive to be a generalist, to know which tool to use, and when.</p>

      <h1>I love the web.</h1>
      <p>I love the possibilities the next generation of web technologies give me. I love learning about them. I love trying them out in real world scenarios. I love to play, hack, write, rant and read even more about all the cool stuff on the web.</p>

      <h1>I got skills.</h1>
      <p>I know loads of stuff. I am a <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Rubyist</a> at heart, but I can handle myself pretty well in <a href="http://www.java.com">Java</a> too. I do web programming in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a>, but I've been known to dabble with <a href="http://jersey.java.net/">Jersey</a> as well. I like <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> better than <a herf="http://subversion.apache.org/">svn</a>, but I can tolerate it if I have to.</p>
